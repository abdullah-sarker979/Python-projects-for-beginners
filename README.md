# Python-projects-for-beginners.
A collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that helped me build a strong foundation in programming. Each project focuses on core concepts such as variables, loops, functions, file handling, and basic problem-solving. Ideal for practice, learning, or reference.


# Beginner Python Projects

This repository contains a curated set of beginner-level Python projects that I built while learning the fundamentals of programming. Each project is simple, readable, and focused on mastering core concepts such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Conditionals  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries  
- Basic algorithms  
- File handling  
- Working with modules  

The goal of this repo is not to show off advanced skills but to demonstrate consistent practice, clean code, and steady improvement.
